            <ul>
                <li>In 1918 Richard Phillips Feynman is born in 
                    Queens, NY.</li>

                <li>When Feynman was 15, he taught himself trigonometry, advanced
                    algebra, infinite series, analytic geometry, and both differential
                    and integral calculus. Before entering college, he was 
                    experimenting with and deriving mathematical topics such as 
                    the half-derivative using his own notation. He created special 
                    symbols for logarithm, sine, cosine and tangent functions so 
                    they did not look like three variables multiplied together, 
                    and for the derivative, to remove the temptation of canceling
                    out the d's.</li>

                <li>He attended to MIT where he originally majored in mathematics,
                    he later switched to electrical engineering, as he considered
                    mathematics to be too abstract. Noticing that he "had gone too far,"
                    he then switched to physics, which he claimed was "somewhere
                    in between."</li>

                <li>He did his graduate and Ph.D studies in Princeton. Attendees
                    at Feynman's first seminar, which was on the classical version 
                    of the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory, included Albert Einstein, 
                    Wolfgang Pauli, and John von Neumann.</li>

                <li>In his doctoral thesis titled "The Principle of Least Action
                    in Quantum Mechanics," Feynman applied the principle of 
                    stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics, inspired
                    by a desire to quantize the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory 
                    of electrodynamics, and laid the groundwork for the path 
                    integral formulation and Feynman diagrams. A key insight was
                    that positrons behaved like electrons moving backwards in 
                    time.</li>

                <li>Feynman worked for the Manhattan Project. He amused himself 
                    by cracking locks. He claimed to be the only person to see 
                    the Trinity nuclear test explosion without the very dark 
                    glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was 
                    safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen 
                    out the harmful ultraviolet radiation.</li>

                <li>One of the conditions of Feynman's scholarship to Princeton 
                    was that he could not be married; nevertheless, he continued 
                    to see his high school sweetheart, Arline Greenbaum, and was
                    determined to marry her once he had been awarded his Ph.D. 
                    despite the knowledge that she was seriously ill with tuberculosis.
                    This was an incurable disease at the time, and she was not
                    expected to live more than two years. On June 29, 1942, they
                    took the ferry to Staten Island, where they were married in 
                    the city office. The ceremony was attended by neither family 
                    nor friends and was witnessed by a pair of strangers. Feynman
                    could only kiss Arline on the cheek. After the ceremony he 
                    took her to Deborah Hospital, where he visited her on 
                    weekends</li>

                <li>For contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics,
                    Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly 
                    with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.</li>

                <li>Feynman was a teacher in Caltech where he gave a great course
                    in introductory physics which was then turn into

                     rel="noopener noreferrer">The Feynman Lectures on Physics</a></li>

                <li>Feynman died on February 15, 1988, at age 69. His last words
                    were: "I'd hate to die twice. It's so boring."</li>
